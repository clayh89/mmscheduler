# mmscheduler

A scheduling app developed in vanilla React. 

The user can: 
Create appointments 
Retrieve (list) appointments
Update (edit) appointments
Delete (cancel) appointments 

For each appointment, there should be a date, time, location, and description.
    Location should be a dropdown/select with the following options: San Diego, Portland, Seattle, London, and Orlando.


The data is not persistent as it lives in the frontend. However, it would be easy to hook up to a more permanent backend 

The app was initialized with create-react-aopp
